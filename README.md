# The Language Club - Backend

## Overview
The backend of The Language Club is built using Node.js and Express.js to serve RESTful APIs. It handles user authentication, role-based authorization, and manages resources such as users, courses, and bookings. The backend communicates securely with the frontend, allowing users to register, log in, and interact with courses according to their roles. MongoDB is used as the database to store all user and course-related data.
